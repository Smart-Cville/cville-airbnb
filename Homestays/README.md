# Explanation of Codes in vtmp_sss Sheet
## List of Charlottesville Residences with 212 or 211 Primary Use Designation

The spreadsheet contains a sheet with residences that have a 212 or 211 Primary Use Designation (and
therefore could be used as an Airbnb), plus a list of current properties with a Homestay permit.

There are many Primary Use Codes, but for our purposes 212 is a single family residence and 211 is a duplex.

Parcel ID is a designation used for property taxes, it's not really relevant for our purposes
